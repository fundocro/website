            About me, hmh... <br>
            There is too much to say in one single web page so I'll keep it simple and clean<br> with my most recent point of view.

    If you are here then you already know my name,<br>
        for the simplicity you can just call me Gogi.<br> 
        <br>
I am 32 years young and currently living in Croatia. <br> 
        My main occupation is my present work and my hobbies.
More about my jobs in the past and present you can look up on Resume Summary page ;).<br>
        <br>
    My hobbies are web development, motorcycle riding, bushcraft/camping, <br>
        one of them I am trying to make as my future source of income, lol guess which one ;)<br>
To be short, I'm just a wannabe web developer trying to get into IT world from my current job.
That's it for now...
