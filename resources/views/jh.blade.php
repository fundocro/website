            The first real paid job that I had was as a teenager, and it was related to sugar and coffee.<br>
            If you're thinking that I was a waiter you are mistaken. <br>
            This job was maybe a couple of days per month and only during the summer break. <br>

        <p>
            It was basically unloading 100 tons of sugar or coffee, contained in 50-kilo bags,
            from cargo trains onto wooden pallets... <br>
            Pay was good considering that I was usually working with my friends and only a few hours or until the job was done.

          I would love to give it a go once more, but I doubt that I would have the same smile on my face now, 16 years later :)

          Ornamental and wrought iron fences are a classic way to fence in property lines, driveways, decks, patios and swimming pools while maintaining an open view from the outside.   <br>
         
            Nobody really asks or cares how does the procedure of those beautiful ornamented pieces of fence come about, been there done that, and never going back.

            Let's continue to my third job as a security guard. <br>
            As I was getting older so with age I had a wish to try out different jobs. 
            Working as a security guard was appealing to me because of the benefits like working in a suit, working in clean environment, carrying a gun, and thrill after all.

            In about a year working and loving my new job, I got promoted and was given work with more responsibility.<br>
            I was assigned to work in a bank with a trusty 9mm Glock at my side. Like I said before this job was thrilling for me so I stayed for a while doing it.

My big thrill at the beginning had a big downfall a few years later. <br>
As my responsibility grew so did my days and nights became 'longer'.<br>
I was working 12 hours every day and on free days, often had more events to attend to, that was a clear sign to move on and bury my sheriff badge for ever ;)...

          The next job is all about wood! I worked as a carpenter for about two and a half years, you don't want to know how I ended up doing that. <br>
            Working with wood is a such a big change compared to work involving iron, especially if you already had business with an iron before.

            <br>
            We made everything from furniture to doors, miniature art like items, to big heavy bulky stuff like bar tables, floors, ceilings, restoration and a bunch of custom stuff for rich people...<br>
            Wood work requires extreme precision, calmness, planning and learns you to be patient and respectful, especially if you are surrounded with guys without few fingers who still love their work!

This job offered once again long hours both indoors and outside on roofs, scaffolds, and so on but a job as a job I learned quick and stuck to it until my curiosity didn't drag me to something new.

            At the moment this is my current job, I spent last 8 years, making mattresses out of wire springs.<br>
            It is done by operating cnc machines specially designed for this purpose.<br>
            It is the most challenging work I had in my working career, 
            because it involves both physical work and full concentration during all 8 hours if you want to earn some serious cash.

        Learning curve for this job was tediously hard and long, it takes a few years of learning to be able to work alone without elder's assistance. It is that kind of job that can leave you surprised even if you are been working for many years.

            Since I became older and hopefuly wiser lol, it has come time to moove again.<br>
            My destination, for next job, is IT sector somewhere in web development hopefully in near future;)

                       Conclusion considering my working career and my experience so far is that I will try to earn my bread using my brain from now on! <br>
                    Since my body is all that I really and truly own, and should spear it of abuse as much as I possibly can in my life journey.
