            The first real paid job that I had was as a teenager, and it was related to sugar and coffee.<br>
            If you're thinking that I was a waiter you are mistaken. <br>
            This job was maybe a couple of days per month and only during the summer break. <br>

        <p>
            It was basically unloading 100 tons of sugar or coffee, contained in 50-kilo bags,
            from cargo trains onto wooden pallets... <br>
            Pay was good considering that I was usually working with my friends and only a few hours or until the job was done.

          I would love to give it a go once more, but I doubt that I would have the same smile on my face now, 16 years later :)

           Good old metal bashing, bending, welding going on here ;).<br>
            This was my first official job, as many people here starting to work in at least one branch of metal industry as a young adult is quite normal.

          Ornamental and wrought iron fences are a classic way to fence in property lines, driveways, decks, patios and swimming pools while maintaining an open view from the outside.   <br>
         
            Nobody really asks or cares how does the procedure of those beautiful ornamented pieces of fence come about, been there done that, and never going back.
